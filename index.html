        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>I'm a junior undergraduate student in the Major of Computer Science (Bachelor of Science) program at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (UMN) College of Science and Engineering. 
        I'm a research assistant at the <a href="http://dmr.cs.umn.edu/" title="UMN Data Analysis and Management Research Group">UMN Data Analysis and Management Research Group</a>, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y4J5SOwAAAAJ&hl=en" title="Prof. Jaideep Srivastava">Prof. Jaideep Srivastava</a> since Fall 2020.
        In Summer 2020, I was supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nq7tuDkAAAAJ&hl=en" title="Prof. Mujdat Cetin">Prof. Mujdat Cetin</a> at the <a href="http://labs.sabanciuniv.edu/spis/" title="Signal Processing and Information Systems Laboratory">Signal Processing and Information Systems Laboratory</a> in University of Rochester.</p>
        
        <p>My current research focuses on Natural Language Processing and text classification, specifically, stance detection in Social Media. My research interests are NLP, Machine Learning
        and Data Mining.</p>

        <h2>Research Projects</h2>
        
          <h3>NLP in Social Media</h3>
          <p>We are interested in stance detection in social media for political affiliation. Stance Detection means automatically detecting whether
          the author of a piece of text is in favor of the given target, which benefits for information retrieval, text summerization, etc. Since manually labeling
          is extremely time consuming and tidious, we mainly focus on weakly supervision and semi-supervised learning. 
            Sometimes text may not express explicity an attitude towards a target, and weakly learning may come into
            noisy labelling issue, in this case, topic-aware methods are needed like using reinforced model to incorporate target-related or cross-target info and then eliminate noisy instances.
  
            We are searching the possibilites of transfer learning and knowledge graph
            for our purpose as well, like feeding semantic-emotion heterogeneous graph constructed from external semantic
            and emotion lexicons into GraphCNN to learn external connections thus enhancing cross-target stance detection. 
            Besides, we extend the binary classification by Valence Score to see the degree of people's stance and sentiment towards the target. Right now, we are
            brainstroming a good research direction related and try to come out some publishable research output this coming Spring.</p>
          <h3>EEG Signal Processing by Deep Learning</h3>
          <p>EEG signal processing connects heavily with Brain-Computer Interaction. People already have researched a lot in this area like
          using different fancy and efficient deep learning framwork to detection emotional stages. We pipelined people's models
            to see if we can enhance the performace. Since the deep leanrning model part is not easy
          to improve right now, we focus on the signal processing part like implementing and comparing different insightful ways
          for data preprocessing including shuffling, taking base signal into consideration and projector the signal, etc.</dd>
