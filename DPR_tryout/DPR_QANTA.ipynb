Leonid Khachiyan was the first to show that this method admits a polynomial-time algorithm by the application of the ellipsoid method.

During the year that ruler of this name ascended to power, his army was decimated at the Battle of Kozluca and he had to consent to the Treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji. The second ruler of this name moved his seat of government to Yildiz Palace. The Dashnak Association attempted to assassinate that ruler with a bomb-loaded carriage.

In many models, this type of physical process would move from a metastable state into activity by the firing of the \"clathrate gun.\" One classic example of this type of process is the accumulation of water vapor in the atmosphere, since water vapor is a greenhouse gas; another classic example is increasing ice cover, since ice boosts a body\\'s albedo and may lead to creation of a \"Snowball Earth.

As a result of success at this battle, the city of Ortona was gifted to the Princes of Sulmona. The winning army was aided by Max Sittich and Georg Frundsberg, who led companies of landsknecht soldiers, as well as arquebusiers under Fernando d\\'Avalos, the Marquis of Pescara. The losing commander was doomed by the defection of 8,000 Swiss soldiers and wrote to his mother that \"all is lost, except honor\" after this battle, which ended the Four Years War. The loser was forced to sign the Treaty of Madrid, though he rebuked it a year later by forming the League of Cognac.

Two different mech- anisms causing this phenomenon cancel each other out in a TROSY experiment. This phenomenon causes intensity losses between pulses in an INEPT sequence. This process can be mathematically modeled by the Solomon equations. The constants that define this process can be measured using inversion-recovery or Hahn echo experiments. This process causes a reduction in intensity over time of an FID signal. This process leads to magnetization transfer between two nuclei in the nuclear Overhauser effect. Larmor precession and this process are modeled by the Bloch equations. It's not coupling, but this process comes in spin-lattice and spin-spin forms characterized by exponential decay times labelled T1 and T2. For 10 points, name this process in which spins return to their equilibrium values after undergoing NMR.\",\n",

The Wigner-Weyl transform of this operation into phase space gives an operation named for José Moyal. A term containing a time derivative and a term containing this operation are found in the Lax equation. The expectation value of this operation is squared on the right hand side of the Robertson inequality. A Lie algebra can be defined from any associative algebra by using this operation as the Lie bracket. Computing the expectation value of this operation applied to momentum and the Hamiltonian is done when deriving Newton's second law from quantum mechanics. This operation applied to position and momentum canonically yields i times h-bar according to the uncertainty principle. This operation is analogous to a Poisson bracket on a Hilbert space. For 10 points, name this operation which for A and B is given by AB minus BA.\",\n",

Cap cells in TEBs can differentiate into a group of cells which produces contractile force during this process called myoepithelial cells. This process canonically involves one paracellular and four transcellular pathways in alveolar cells. Bile salt-stimulated lipase is produced during this process, which initially generates a substance rich in transferrin and secretory IgA to provide passive immunity. This process occurs after parturition in an estrous cycle, and it causes the release of colostrum within the first few days.

Its final leader Gotthard Kettler was defeated at Ergeme and became the \"Duke of Courland and Semigallia\" after this group was dissolved in 1561, in the midst of a war which shares its name with this group. Originally known as the Brothers of the Sword, this group was pushed back at the Battle of Lake Peipus by the Novgorod Republic.

He coined the terms \"awfulizing,\" and \"catastrophizing\" to describe behavior that should be fought with shame-attack exercises. He called the harmful act of imposing absolute values on the world \"musturbation.\" Many of his ideas, such as the distinction between \"discomfort disturbances\" and \"ego disturbances,\" were developed while he writing Sex Without Guilt and The Art and Science of Love. This thinker developed a model of causation in which an activating event induces a belief, which itself is responsible for a human feeling - that is the \"ABC\" model. Like Aaron Beck, this psychologist developed an individualist approach that seeks to correct harmful behavior by converting socially destructive tendencies to constructive ones.

The unusual iconography of this painting include the use of two halos - one surrounds the central figure's head, and one surrounds the five lit and one unlit candles below him. Other unusual symbols that the artist chose include the substitution of a prayer shawl for a loincloth and the use of a head cloth instead of the crown of thorns.

Another piece in this genre imitates the sound of the zampogna, a bagpipe played by Italian shepherds, in its final movement Pastorale.

The run-up to this incident saw one party abrogate the Mackinnon Treaty, which would have surrendered territory as far north as the Lado Enclave. That led Edward Grey to issue a warning in a speech given on behalf of Archibald Primrose. Prior to this incident, Major J.A.L. Macdonald was initially chosen to conduct a secret operation after news about the steamer Faidherbe and its mission reached the government of Lord Salisbury. Subsequently, the former victor at the Battle of Omdurman was tabbed to lead a flotilla of gunboats that ran into a force under Jean-Baptiste Marchand. This event eventually led to the Entente Cordiale. For 10 points, name this diplomatic incident in 1898 that saw France and Britain race each other to claim a muddy fort in Africa.',\n",

According to its composer, this song was inspired by the \"clackety-clack, clackety-clack\" noises of a horse-drawn wagon moving over cobblestones. This song, which is usually recorded in the key of concert F, opens with a head in which the ninth and tenth bars are repeated twice for a total of 16 bars in its blues form. A Simha Arom and Genviève Taurelle LP inspired a version of this song in which Bill Summers imitated the sound of a hindewhu by blowing into a beer bottle. This song originally appeared on the album Takin\\' Off, but was the subject of a popular recording by Mongo Santamaria in 1963; a later recording made by its composer added in funk elements and is found on the album Head Hunters.

Extrapolating the entropy curve for this phenomenon paradoxically yields a zero change in entropy below a critical temperature, a result derived by Kauzmann. The temperature dependence of viscosity in this phenomenon can be measured by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation, the Doolittle equation, or the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation.

The Chirascan is a brand of spectrometer used for this technique. Spectrometers for this technique can be calibrated using pantolactone or 10-camphorsulfonic acid as standards. Calculation of data using this technique often involves multiplying delta- epsilon by 3298 to get theta. This technique produces prominent peaks in the far-UV range at 190, 208, and 222 nanometers. Measurements in this technique are often reported in terms of ellipticity. This technique works by measuring a molecule's difference in absorption between left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light.

This ruler\\'s army achieved victory at Kunersdorf but then withdrew after this ruler died, in a sequence dubbed the \"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg.\" This ruler, served by the Shuvalov family, deposed Ivan VI after returning from exile at a nunnery, where she was sent by her father\\'s niece Anna.

In the second movement of another concerto for this instrument, before the last two measures the accompaniment consists entirely of sixteenth notes in the first violin and eighth notes in the rest of the non-soloist parts. Another concerto for this instrument features an andante spiccato opening movement and a second movement adagio that was transcribed for harpsichord by J.S. Bach. In Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestral arrangement of Polovetsian Dances, this instrument introduces the theme of the first dance. Concerti in D minor for this instrument were written by Alessandro Marcello and Tomaso Albinoni. A similar instrument lacks this instrument's low B flat key but otherwise has the same fingerings and is pitched a fifth lower; that instrument is the English horn. For 10 points, name this double reed woodwind instrument that plays the tuning note before orchestra performances.\",\n",

A current debate is whether the howardite-eucrite-diogenite, or HED, group of these objects can truly be tied to a single basaltic parent body. Unique samples of these objects were thoughtfully frozen after being discovered at Tagish Lake. A 1996 paper by Shu, Shang, and Lee proposed a theory of these objects which suggests that magneto-centrifugally driven winds made their calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions. Etching with a weak acid exposes bands of kamacite and taenite called Widmanstätten patterns in these objects.
